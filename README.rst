Overview
############

a simple html+js program to record / capture ones screen or camera and or audio using browsers capability for same.

Keep ur data on your computer and no need to register anywhere or install extensions or any other bshit...

If this doesnt work, due to any restrictions enforced by the browser, one could look at ffmpeg and its kmsgrab.
There was a issue with kmsgrab and framebuffer tiling used by the graphic cards, there is patch for same and bit
more in my old (2020?) ffmpeg fork. I ran out of patience trying to get the patches upstreamed ... You may find
the patches from ffmpeg mailing list also.
